*Main points
- agentstate logic for each state
- edge cases when transitioning between states
- is clonedstate necessary? no, goalstste will suffice
- bombs should be goals...
- terrain logic, think about it
- floodfill to find rafts, no seen rafts, messy
- what is an obstruction and what isnt, and when?
- proper graph for map

WATER TRAVEL 
*When is it OK to travel on water? or go to water?
- only when agent has a raft
*When is it not OK to travel on water?
- when no raft
- when in land explore mode
*When is it NOT OK to cross from water onto land?
- when in water explore mode
---crossing land when on water should lead to dead end in A* state search as cant continue...

STATE LOGIC 
*land explore (starts out on land)
-go into explore function, if it returns actions, follow them
-failing the above, if there is a goal go into goal pursuit, failing that if has axe go into water explore
*water explore (starts out on water)
-as above essentiall, except if there is unexplored land, go there
*goal pursuit
-pursue a goal if there is one, if that results in actions do them
-if there's no goal or no actions from the only goal there, see if fetching a raft will help 
(enqueu that goal and return without change state - while loop)
-if still nothing, go to other states

STATE TRANSITIONS
*Land explore -> water explore
- if no raft, first get raft before transitioning to water explore
- do not transition if raft not able to be collected
*Water explore -> land explore
- if not already on land, go to nearest unexplored land before transition (floodfill)
- if not land reached, do not change state
*Goal pursuit
- always favour pursuing a goal over exploring, if there's a goal, go for it

TREES
- trees are not to be cleared on land exploration
- trees are to be cleared in a path to unexplored land, or to goal, ONLY (boolean toggle in state?)

LAND EXPLORE STATE
- explore all immediately reachable land, collecting items and going through doors if needed. DO NOT power through trees
- if there remains reachable unexplored land, go there and continue, THROUGH TREES TO GET THERE IF NEED be
- if all land explored and none left that can be reached, transition:
1. go into goal pursuit if there exists a goal
2. go into water exploration is there exists reachable unexplored water (and then only if a raft grabbable)

WATER EXPLORE STATE
- simply explore all reachable water that does not require crossing land, strict water-only state
- if no more water left, transition:
1. go into goal pursuit if there exists a goal
2. go to land if there exists reachable unexplored land S

GOAL PURSUIT STATE
- if there is a goal, deque it, and pursue it
- if goal not reachable or no goal available, transition:
1. go to land if there exists reachable unexplored land
2. go into water exploration is there exists reachable unexplored water (and then only if a raft grabbable)

GoalState
- track raft, key, bombs, onwater
- use instead of cloning state (above will suffice for terrain mgmt)

floodfill
- used to return reachable land, water, rafts in lieu of "seen item" lists
- alternative implementation for counting reachable items...

OBSTRUCTIONS ETC
-k,a,d,$: all items, collectible
-T: not to be cleared when exploring land, except when going to new unexplored region and way needs to be cleared (change state to goal? will fall abck to land first)
 but trees clearable during goal pursuit (handled in GoalState - slightly higher path cost)

BOMB GOALS 
- want add bombs as goals but not add multiple, when it is reached we want to floodfill to find nearest...
- OR we add them and when one is selected, find the nearest

TERRAIN 
-all terrain changes occur with state changes, or collecting of rafts, or on stepping off water

STEPS
1. get graph working (DONE!)
2. floodfill find reachable items (DONE!)
3. state transitions (DONE! i think...)
4. obstructions and terrain mngr
5. goal state and search logic, dont need heuristics, clean up path logic....
6. add item scoring to astar f value calculations (separate function)

TODO
1. bomb goal logic...
2. configure goalmngr for all goals
3. 

CURRENT ISSUES
-need good bomb logic to choose best bomb!! prototype in place...
-terrain mngr in goalstate stops using bombs unnecessarily in s7 but then it fails on s0 when finding reachbale water...
-need to make reachability more complicated (not visited for terrain...)
